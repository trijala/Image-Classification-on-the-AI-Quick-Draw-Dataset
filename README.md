# Image-Classification-on-the-AI-Quick-Draw-Dataset

A subsampled Quick Draw data set with 10 categories including ‘apple’, ‘basketball’, ‘arm’, ‘horse’, ‘ant’, ‘axe’, ‘alarm clock’, ‘airplane’, ‘banana’ and ‘bed’.

Each category includes 12,500 images with the size of 28 × 28

The data set has been separated as training features, training labels, testing features and testing labels.

In the code, we iteratively use the load function provided by the pickle package to extract those data from the data set.

Implemented a multi-layered perceptron on the provided data as you change the complexity of the model by changing the number of hidden layers.
